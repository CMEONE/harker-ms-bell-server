# Google Assistant

There's an even easier way to access the bell schedule and lunch menuâ€”using the Google Assistant. This works on any device with Google Assistant enabled, including Android phones, Apple phones (with the [Google Assistant app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-assistant/id1220976145)), and certain smart speakers. Try it out now!

## Getting the bell schedule

I have provided several types of commands for accessing the bell schedule.

> **Hey Google, tell me the bell schedule for tomorrow.**

> **Hey Google, tell me the bell schedule on December 1st.**

The rest of the commands listed on this page require the prefix, **"ask HarkerDev,"** due to the way Google handles implicit command invocation.

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev for the bell schedule next Friday.~~** Coming soon!

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's the bell schedule today?~~** Coming soon!

You can also ask for more timely information. This can be useful during the school day or between classes.

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's the next period?~~** Coming soon!

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, when does the next period start?~~** Coming soon!

## Getting the lunch menu

You can access the lunch menu in a similar way.

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's the lunch menu today?~~** Coming soon!

> **~~Hey Google, ask HarkerDev, what's at Fresh Mex tomorrow?~~** Coming soon!
