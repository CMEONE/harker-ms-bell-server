# Troubleshooting

Experiencing problems? Follow these steps to fix commonly seen issues.

1. If the website isn't working as expected, try resetting the web app by visiting these special URLs in order until the issue is resolved:
   - [msbell.harker.xyz/?force_reset=1](https://msbell.harker.xyz/?force_reset=1): Clears all saved schedules and retrieves a fresh copy.
   - [msbell.harker.xyz/?force_reset=2](https://msbell.harker.xyz/?force_reset=2): Clears all saved schedules, clears cached resources, and resets offline mode.
   - **msbell.harker.xyz/?force_reset=3**: Clears everything stored on the site, including ALL of your settings and customizations! Use this option as a last resort.
2. If the problem persists, try it in Incognito or Private mode first. If that works, you might have a browser extension that's interfering with the site. Try disabling your extensions (especially ad blockers) until the issue is resolved.
